# purescript-typedefs-interop

**DEAD END EXPERIMENT: this turned out to be an unviable approach.**

Direct interop with the ASTs of parsed Typedefs terms from PureScript.

## Introduction

The JavaScript generated by Idris needs preprocessing:

* Replace `let` by `var` (downgrade to ES5)
* Remove shebang and wrapper nullary function
* Add `exports.deserialize0 = ` to `function Main__deserialize0`

## Usage

```bash
npm i
npm run test
```
